These are conclusions. Here you can look at the problem, method, results, and reflect on the overall project outcomes, particular objectives and other aspects.

\section{Review of Project Goals}

If you provided clear and detailed goals and objectives in the introductory part of your thesis, then it is a good idea to review them here and outline how (ir if, or to what extent) each of them has been achieved.

\section{Context}

It is important to be able to put your work in the environmental, societal, ethical, and enterprise context. Of course, not all works contribute significantly to each of the aspects, however it is important to provide critical review of your work.

\section{Future Works}

In most cases, the completed work open new opportunities. Or it might be that not all possible ways to solve the problem could be explored. In this section you can outline possible directions of future work that you find the most relevant given your knowledge and experiences in this project.
